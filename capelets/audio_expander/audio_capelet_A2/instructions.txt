Revision History:

A1 (May 2016)		Initial design.
A2 (July 2016)		Fixed which 5V power traces are used.
			Fixed missing trace to reference voltage regulator.
			Fixed connection of resistors on analog in amplifiers.
			Added new connector J11 which allows disconnecting from audio in.
			Clarified numbering of connector J12 which should be socket 
			like J11.
			Minor layout change on bottom layer to make orientation of
			components less ambiguous.
			Board outline is slightly elongated to allow for J11.
			Renumbered I/Os from 1-8 to 0-7.
